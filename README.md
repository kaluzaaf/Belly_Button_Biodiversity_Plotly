# Belly_Button_Biodiversity_Plotly

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to build a tool which will allow researchers and participants to easily search a catalogue of belly button biodiversity. The tool will help researchers identify particular bacteria that will give their plant-based product the "meat-like" flavor that will be critical if the product is to gain wider adoption. The tool also allows participants the opportunity to examine their own biodiversity residing in their belly button's which they might be able to sell to the company.

## Outcome
The end state is a tool that will allow researchers to easily isolate bacteria across all of the studyâ€™s participants. The tool allows them to identify the top 10 bacteria cultures found in each belly button, the number of times the belly button was scrubbed per week, the participants demographic information, and the bacteria cultures per sample. This will allow for researches to more easily identify commonalities that tend to result in the production of a particular type of bacteria. The tool also serves as an easy way to inform participants about the potential gold mine of bacteria in their own belly buttons.
